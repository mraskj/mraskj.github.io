I have submitted my PhD dissertation at January 31, 2025, at Aarhus University (🇩🇰), [Department of Political Science](https://ps.au.dk/en/). The dissertation is scheduled for defense on March 28, 2025, and is titled: The Sound of Politics: How Politicians Pitch Conflict, Representation, and Power. Currently, a Research Assistant (pre-defense) and Post Doc. (post-defense) until July 1, 2025.

My research concerns the use of cutting-edge data (e.g., audio collections) and computational methods to study politicians' behavior. In the dissertation, I investigate when and how politicians change the sound of their voices to convey their positions and priorities. The dataset is based on a large collection of audio recordings of parliamentary debates in the Danish Parliament from 2000-2022. The recordings are aligned with their corresponding transcripts to facilitate joint text-audio analysis.

Besides work, I'm a sport enthusiast, watching soccer ⚽, cycling 🚴🏽, football 🏈, baseball ⚾, hockey 🏒, and lots of other sports, enjoy listening to music 🎵, go spearfishing 🦞🐟, or making sport myself. I live in Nordvest, Copenhagen, with my three favorite people: my wife Katrine and our two daughters Ingrid and Edith.
