I'm a **PhD student** at the [Department of Political Science](https://ps.au.dk/en/) at Aarhus University (Denmark 🇩🇰). In the spring 2024, I'll visit University of Toronto (Canada 🇨🇦)

I study political elites from both a politicians-as-representatives and politicians-as-legislators perspective using cutting-edge data and computational methods. I develop new computational methods and measures, and compile new data sources based on unstructured data sources such as text, audio, and video data.

My dissertation studies how we can compile and analyze audio recordings of parliamentary speeches focusing on the Danish Parliament. I collect a comprehension text-audio corpus of parliamentary speeches from 2000-2022 and show that *how* politicians vary their voice holds important implications for our understanding of partisan conflict and political representation.

Besides work, I'm a sport enthusiast, watching football ⚽, cycling 🚴🏽, and lots of other sports (🎾, 🏸, 🏈, 🏀, 🎿, ...), enjoy listening to music 🎵, or go spearfishing 🦞🐟. I follow [FC Midtjylland](https://www.fcm.dk/) very closely as you will probably tell from Twitter. I live in Nordvest, Copenhagen, with my two favorite people: my wife Katrine and our daughter Ingrid.
