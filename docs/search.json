First and foremost, I validate the empirical use of political speech recordings by investigating the accuracy of annotations across multiple countries and their sensitivity to the estimation of nonverbal features.

We expand the study of partisan conflict to the nonverbal dimension by developing a measure of nonverbal conflict signaling based on variation in speakers’ vocal pitch.

We find that nonverbal conflict signals reflect prevailing patterns of partisan polarization and predict subsequent legislative behavior. Moreover, consistent with a strategic model of behavior, we show that nonverbal conflict signals track the electoral and policy incentives faced by legislators. All results persist when accounting for the verbal content of speech. By documenting a novel dimension of elite communication of partisan conflict and providing evidence for the strategic use of nonverbal signals, our findings deepen our understanding of the nature of elite partisan communication."

    "text": "I’m a PhD student at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University (Denmark 🇩🇰). In the spring 2024, I’ll visit University of Toronto (Canada 🇨🇦)\nI study political elites from both a politicians-as-representatives and politicians-as-legislators perspective using cutting-edge data and computational methods. I develop new computational methods and measures, and compile new data sources based on unstructured data sources such as text, audio, and video data.\nMy dissertation studies how we can compile and analyze audio recordings of parliamentary speeches focusing on the Danish Parliament. I collect a comprehension text-audio corpus of parliamentary speeches from 2000-2022 and show that how politicians vary their voice holds important implications for our understanding of partisan conflict and political representation.\nBesides work, I’m a sport enthusiast, watching football ⚽, cycling 🚴🏽, and lots of other sports (🎾, 🏸, 🏈, 🏀, 🎿, …), enjoy listening to music 🎵, or go spearfishing 🦞🐟. I follow FC Midtjylland very closely as you will probably tell from Twitter. I live in Nordvest, Copenhagen, with my two favorite people: my wife Katrine and our daughter Ingrid."
