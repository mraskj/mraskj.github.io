I'm a **PhD student** at the [Department of Political Science](https://ps.au.dk/en/) at Aarhus University (Denmark 🇩🇰). In the spring 2024, I'll visit University of Toronto (Canada 🇨🇦)

I study the behavior and communication of politicians and parties using cutting-edge data and computational methods. In my dissertation, I develop measures of politicians' use of issue emphasis and nonverbal behavior based on a large collection of audio recordings of parliamentary speeches in the Danish Parliament from 2000-2022.

Substantially, I use these new methods and data sources to understand political representation, legislative politics, and party competition. For instance, in a recent working paper (coauthored with Frederik Hjorth) we show that legislators use nonverbal signals to communicate partisan and policy conflict.

Besides work, I'm a sport enthusiast, watching football ⚽, cycling 🚴🏽, and lots of other sports (🎾, 🏸, 🏈, 🏀, 🎿, ...), enjoy listening to music 🎵, or go spearfishing 🦞🐟. I follow [FC Midtjylland](https://www.fcm.dk/) very closely as you will probably tell from Twitter. I live in Nordvest, Copenhagen, with my two favorite people: my wife Katrine and our daughter Ingrid.
