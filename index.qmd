I work as a Data Engineer in the Machine Learning Lab at the Danish Business Authority. Previously, I was a researcher at Aarhus University, stuyding and developing computational methods and data pipelines for unstructured data sources to the behavior of political elites.

Besides work, I'm a sport enthusiast, watching soccer ⚽, cycling 🚴🏽, football 🏈, baseball ⚾, hockey 🏒, and lots of other sports, enjoy listening to music 🎵, go spearfishing 🦞🐟, or making sport myself. I live in Nordvest, Copenhagen, with my three favorite people: my wife Katrine and our two daughters Ingrid and Edith.
