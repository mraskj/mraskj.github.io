The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First and foremost, I validate the empirical use of political speech recordings by investigating the accuracy of annotations across multiple countries and their sensitivity to the estimation of nonverbal features. Second, I develop a method that can automatically annotate speech recordings with timestamps, speaker tags, the text of speech, and nonverbal features with close to human accuracy, while still being invariant to language and speech setting (e.g. legislative vs. campaign speech).

We expand the study of partisan conflict to the nonverbal dimension by developing a measure of nonverbal conflict signaling based on variation in speakers’ vocal pitch. We demonstrate our approach using comprehensive audio data from parliamentary debates in Denmark spanning more than two decades. We find that nonverbal conflict signals reflect prevailing patterns of partisan polarization and predict subsequent legislative behavior. Moreover, consistent with a strategic model of behavior, we show that nonverbal conflict signals track the electoral and policy incentives faced by legislators. All results persist when accounting for the verbal content of speech. By documenting a novel dimension of elite communication of partisan conflict and providing evidence for the strategic use of nonverbal signals, our findings deepen our understanding of the nature of elite partisan communication."

    "text": "Welcome! I’m a PhD student at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University (Denmark 🇩🇰). In the spring 2024, I’ll visit University of Toronto (Canada 🇨🇦)\nSubstantially, my research focuses on the representation and legislation provided by elected politicians. Methodologically, I develop and employ novel computational methods to analyze unstructured data sources such as text, audio, and video data.\nMy dissertation develops a new theoretical concept emotional representation, which describes the way legislators use emotional rhetoric and expressions to represent citizens. To do this, I use a large collection of audio recordings of legislative proceedings to construct measures of vocal expressions of emotions based on pitch.\nBesides work, I’m a sport enthusiast, watching football ⚽, cycling 🚴🏽, and lots of other sports (🎾, 🏸, 🏈, 🏀, 🎿, …), enjoy listening to music 🎵, or go spearfishing 🦞🐟. I follow FC Midtjylland very closely as you will probably tell from Twitter. I live in Nordvest, Copenhagen, with my two favorite people: my wife Katrine and our daughter Ingrid."
