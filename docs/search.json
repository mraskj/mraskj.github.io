First and foremost, I validate the empirical use of political speech recordings by investigating the accuracy of annotations across multiple countries and their sensitivity to the estimation of nonverbal features. Second, I develop a method that can automatically annotate speech recordings with timestamps, speaker tags, the text of speech, and nonverbal features with close to human accuracy, while still being invariant to language and speech setting (e.g. legislative vs. campaign speech).

We expand the study of partisan conflict to the nonverbal dimension by developing a measure of nonverbal conflict signaling based on variation in speakers’ vocal pitch. We demonstrate our approach using comprehensive audio data from parliamentary debates in Denmark spanning more than two decades. We find that nonverbal conflict signals reflect prevailing patterns of partisan polarization and predict subsequent legislative behavior. Moreover, consistent with a strategic model of behavior, we show that nonverbal conflict signals track the electoral and policy incentives faced by legislators. All results persist when accounting for the verbal content of speech. By documenting a novel dimension of elite communication of partisan conflict and providing evidence for the strategic use of nonverbal signals, our findings deepen our understanding of the nature of elite partisan communication."

    "text": "I’m a PhD student at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University (Denmark 🇩🇰). In the spring 2024, I’ll visit University of Toronto (Canada 🇨🇦)\nI study the behavior and communication of politicians and parties using cutting-edge data and computational methods. In my dissertation, I develop measures of politicians’ use of issue emphasis and nonverbal behavior based on a large collection of audio recordings of parliamentary speeches in the Danish Parliament from 2000-2022.\nSubstantially, I use these new methods and data sources to understand political representation, legislative politics, and party competition. For instance, in a recent working paper (coauthored with Frederik Hjorth) we show that legislators use nonverbal signals to communicate partisan and policy conflict.\nBesides work, I’m a sport enthusiast, watching football ⚽, cycling 🚴🏽, and lots of other sports (🎾, 🏸, 🏈, 🏀, 🎿, …), enjoy listening to music 🎵, or go spearfishing 🦞🐟. I follow FC Midtjylland very closely as you will probably tell from Twitter. I live in Nordvest, Copenhagen, with my two favorite people: my wife Katrine and our daughter Ingrid.\nContact:\nPhone: (+45) 20 68 02 10\nEmail: [mathiasrask\\@ps.au.dk](mailto:mathiasrask@ps.au.dk)\nTwitter/X: [\\@mathiasrask95](http://twitter.com/mathiasrask95)\nGithub: [\\@](https://github.com/fghjorth)[mraskj](https://github.com/mraskj)"
