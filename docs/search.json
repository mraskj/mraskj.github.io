The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First and foremost, I validate the empirical use of political speech recordings by investigating the accuracy of annotations across multiple countries and their sensitivity to the estimation of nonverbal features. Second, I develop a method that can automatically annotate speech recordings with timestamps, speaker tags, the text of speech, and nonverbal features with close to human accuracy, while still being invariant to language and speech setting (e.g.¬†legislative vs.¬†campaign speech).

We expand the study of partisan conflict to the nonverbal dimension by developing a measure of nonverbal conflict signaling based on variation in speakers‚Äô vocal pitch. We demonstrate our approach using comprehensive audio data from parliamentary debates in Denmark spanning more than two decades. We find that nonverbal conflict signals reflect prevailing patterns of partisan polarization and predict subsequent legislative behavior. Moreover, consistent with a strategic model of behavior, we show that nonverbal conflict signals track the electoral and policy incentives faced by legislators. All results persist when accounting for the verbal content of speech. By documenting a novel dimension of elite communication of partisan conflict and providing evidence for the strategic use of nonverbal signals, our findings deepen our understanding of the nature of elite partisan communication."

    "text": "I have submitted my PhD dissertation at January 31, 2025, at Aarhus University (üá©üá∞), Department of Political Science. The dissertation is scheduled for defense on March 28, 2025, and is titled: The Sound of Politics: How Politicians Pitch Conflict, Representation, and Power. Currently, a Research Assistant (pre-defense) and Post Doc. (post-defense) until July 1, 2025.\nMy research concerns the use of cutting-edge data (e.g., audio collections) and computational methods to study politicians‚Äô behavior. In the dissertation, I investigate when and how politicians change the sound of their voices to convey their positions and priorities. The dataset is based on a large collection of audio recordings of parliamentary debates in the Danish Parliament from 2000-2022. The recordings are aligned with their corresponding transcripts to facilitate joint text-audio analysis.\nBesides work, I‚Äôm a sport enthusiast, watching soccer ‚öΩ, cycling üö¥üèΩ, football üèà, baseball ‚öæ, hockey üèí, and lots of other sports, enjoy listening to music üéµ, go spearfishing ü¶ûüêü, or making sport myself. I live in Nordvest, Copenhagen, with my three favorite people: my wife Katrine and our two daughters Ingrid and Edith."
