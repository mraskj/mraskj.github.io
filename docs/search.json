    "text": "Audio and video recordings are increasingly popular for studying the nonverbal dimensions of political speech. However, annotations such as timestamps and speaker tags that accompany these recordings are often inaccurate, disparate, or entirely lacking, which significantly limits the ability to systematically explore the political implications of nonverbal speech. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First and foremost, I validate the empirical use of political speech recordings by investigating the accuracy of annotations across multiple countries and their sensitivity to the estimation of nonverbal features. Second, I develop a method that can automatically annotate speech recordings with timestamps, speaker tags, the text of speech, and nonverbal features with close to human accuracy, while still being invariant to language and speech setting (e.g. legislative vs. campaign speech). I demonstrate the potential of annotated speech recordings with two substantive applications based on a newly compiled dataset of more than 20,000 hours of aligned text-audio data of parliamentary speech from six European countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElite polarization is an important feature of democratic politics and is in some cases rising sharply, with potentially adverse consequences for democratic citizenship. Political scientists have developed an array of tools for characterizing elite conflict in communication, typically based on legislative speech. However, these approaches consider only the verbal content of communication. We expand the study of elite conflict and polarization to the nonverbal dimension using audio data from more than a decade of parliamentary proceedings in Denmark’s parliament. We find that elite partisan polarization is clearly manifested in legislators’ vocal style, that polarization in vocal style predicts parliamentary voting, and that elite vocal style predicts mass affective polarization. We also document the findings’ robustness to accounting for the verbal content of speech. Our findings document a novel dimension of elite partisan polarization, broadening our understanding of how elites communicate partisan conflict to citizens."

    "text": "Welcome! I’m a PhD student at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University (Denmark 🇩🇰). In the spring 2024, I’ll visit University of Toronto (Canada 🇨🇦)\nSubstantially, my research focuses on the representation and legislation provided by elected politicians. Methodologically, I develop and employ novel computational methods to analyze unstructured data sources such as text, audio, and video data.\nMy dissertation develops a new theoretical concept emotional representation, which describes the way legislators use emotional rhetoric and expressions to represent citizens. To do this, I use a large collection of audio recordings of legislative proceedings to construct measures of vocal expressions of emotions based on pitch.\nBesides work, I’m a sport enthusiast, watching football ⚽, cycling 🚴🏽, and lots of other sports (🎾, 🏸, 🏈, 🏀, 🎿, …), enjoy listening to music 🎵, or go spearfishing 🦞🐟. I follow FC Midtjylland very closely as you will probably tell from Twitter. I live in Nordvest, Copenhagen, with my two favorite people: my wife Katrine and our daughter Ingrid."
